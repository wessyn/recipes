    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In this recipe, cauliflower florets are steamed to tender perfection, then lightly smashed to create the ideal surface for crisp, golden Parmesan “cheese skirts,” as our Test Kitchen calls them. The result is an irresistible combination of textures: the crunch of crispy Parmesan paired with perfectly seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth cauliflower.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) head cauliflower, cut into medium to large florets</li>

            <li>1/2 cup water</li>

            <li>1 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li>chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>

            <li>ranch dressing, for dipping (optional)</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place cauliflower in a large microwave-safe bowl. Add water; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on HIGH until stalks are just tender enough to pierce with a paring knife, about 4 minutes. Drain well. Wipe bowl clean and return drained cauliflower to bowl.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in an even layer over the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Add oil, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to cauliflower; toss until evenly coated. Place in an even layer on top of the Parmesan cheese on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Use a heavy-bottomed glass or jar to smash cauliflower florets, taking care not to break them fully apart. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is crispy and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Break apart if needed. Garnish with parsley and serve with ranch dressing, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
