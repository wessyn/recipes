                <li>Add cornstarch and cold water to a small jar with a lid. Cover and shake until combined and mixture is a thick slurry. Pour over beef mixture.</li>
                <li>Cook over medium-high heat until thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in reserved spaghetti and cook 2 minutes more. Turn heat off and let sit for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle each serving with green onion and sesame seeds.</li>
